# Isolating Tests with Selenium and JUnit

In previous exercises, tests had to be executed in a specific order to pass.

In this exercise, weâ€™ll make the tests **independent** so they always succeed, no matter the order.


## Exercise: Add Song Setup to the Edit Test

If your edit test depends on a song being present:
- Move the **add song** logic to the start of the edit test

This ensures the test is self-contained and doesn't depend on previous test execution.

## Exercise: Cleaning Up After Each Test

We want the test data to be reset after each test execution.

You can do this by navigating to the reset endpoint:

```java
driver.get("http://localhost:8081/reset");
```

Add this line at the end of your test method, for both:
- The `create song` test
- The `edit song` test

> **Note:** Donâ€™t worry about code duplication for now â€” weâ€™ll refactor this later.

After adding this, run your tests again. You should notice:
- Each test now resets the state
- They are no longer order-dependent
- Your application ends in a clean state after testing

## Bonus Exercise: Use `@BeforEach` and `@AfterEach` for Cleanup

Instead of repeating the reset step in each test, use JUnitâ€™s `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` annotation to handle cleanup globally:

```java
@AfterEach
public void resetApplication() {
    driver.get("http://localhost:8081/reset");
}
```

This method will run after **every test**, keeping your code cleaner and more maintainable.


## Summary

- We made tests independent by ensuring setup and teardown is included
- We ensured a consistent app state before/after each test
- We used `@AfterEach` to reduce duplication and group shared logic

You're now writing more stable, maintainable end-to-end tests with Selenium ðŸš€
