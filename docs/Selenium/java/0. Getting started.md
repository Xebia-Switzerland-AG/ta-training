# Getting started with Selenium & Java

## Welcome!

These pages serve as an introduction to Selenium for End-to-End (E2E) testing using Java. You can go through the exercises at your own pace. Read carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java JDK 17 or newer** â†’ [https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** â†’ [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
- **Git** â†’ [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- **Maven** â†’ [https://maven.apache.org/install.html](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- **Selenium IDE** (Test Recorder extension) â†’ [https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/)

### SUT - TabTracker

In order to run the SUT (system under test) project locally for this course, it is required that you have `Node` installed.

If you don't have these installed yet you can find them here:

- https://nodejs.org/en (Choose the LTS version)

Afterwards follow the instructions in the next section 'Checking out the project'.

## Checking out the project

1. Fork the [project from GitHub](https://github.com/Xebia-Switzerland-AG/ta-training) to your own Github account. You can do this by clicking on the link and when it opens in the upper right corner on the `Fork` button. In the next window specify a name and click on `Create fork`.
2. Create a folder on your machine where you would like to have your code in
3. Clone the forked repository into that folder by using the following command in a terminal:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/[your account]/[your forked repository name].git [your directory]
```

This downloads all the source code into the folder.

4. Navigate to the folder

## Setting up the project in IntelliJ

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `File â†’ New â†’ Project`.
3. Select as Location the new checked out folder from the repository 
4. Select **Maven** and JDK **20**.
5. Enter the project name (e.g., `selenium-training`) and click **Create**.
6. After the project is created, open the `pom.xml` file and add the dependencies by adding the following part after `</properties>`:

```xml
  <dependencies>
    <!-- Selenium Java Bindings -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
      <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
      <version>4.29.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- JUnit 5 for Testing -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
      <version>5.9.2</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
      <version>5.9.2</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.junit.platform</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-platform-launcher</artifactId>
      <version>1.9.2</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```
7. Right-click the project â†’ Maven (symbol) â†’ Reload Project, so IntelliJ downloads the required libraries.

### About Maven (optional)
**Maven** is a **build and dependency management tool for Java projects**.  
It automates compiling code, downloading libraries, running tests, and packaging the project.

See [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html) for more information.

In the root folder of a Maven project, youâ€™ll find a file called `pom.xml`.  
This file defines:

- Which **Java dependencies** (like Selenium or JUnit) your project needs
- Which **Java version** your project uses
- Which **plugins and goals** (e.g. for running tests or building reports) should be used
- Optional scripts or configuration for CI/CD pipelines

When you run:

```bash
mvn install
```

Maven reads your `pom.xml`, downloads all required libraries from the **Maven Central Repository**, compiles your code, runs the tests, and builds the output.

### About NPM (optional)

The SUT is in TypeScript written. NPM is a package manager for Node.js. See [npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm#what-is-npm) for more info.
In both the folders 'server' and 'client' you find a file called package.json.
This package.json holds all the information (names, versions) about the npm packages that are used in the project.
When you run `npm i`, it gathers all the names and versions and tries to install these packages from the public NPM registry.

The package.json file also defines scripts as shortcuts.
In this case you may see a line in the `client/package.json` with: "start": "node build/dev-server.js".
This will allow you to type `npm run start` in your terminal instead of `node build/dev-server.js`.
