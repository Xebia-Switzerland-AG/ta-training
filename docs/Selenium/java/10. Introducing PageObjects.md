# Introducing Page Objects, Setup and Teardown in Selenium (Java)

In this chapter, we introduce a fundamental concept in test automation: **Page Objects**. This design pattern improves test maintainability, readability, and structure by separating logic from test flow.


## 🧠 Why Use Page Objects?

- Avoid duplication
- **Centralize logic** related to UI/API interactions
- Easier maintenance when the UI/API changes
- More expressive and readable test cases

## Exercise: Change your project to use a Page Object structur

### 📦 Structure Overview (Example)
Everything should be structured, based on the logic. You can use this example or write your own structure. Keep it as simple as possible.

```
src/main/java/utils
├── ui/
│   └── SongPage.java         <-- Page Object for UI (songs)
├── api/
│   └── ApiClient.java        <-- Page Object for API (songs)
├── models/
│   └── Song.java             <-- Data Model

src/test/java/
├── api/
│   └── ApiTests.java          <-- Tests using Api-PageObjects
└── ui/
    └── SongTests.java         <-- Tests using UI-/API-PageObjects
```


### ✍️ Page Object: SongHelper.java

Encapsulates UI behavior around creating, editing, and verifying songs.

Starts like this:

```java
    public class SongPage {

    private WebDriver driver;
    private WebDriverWait wait;

    public SongPage(WebDriver driver, WebDriverWait wait) {
        this.driver = driver;
        this.wait = wait;
    }
    ....
```

#### Example methods:
- `openApplication()`
- `createSong(Song song)`
- `searchForSong(Song song)`
- `assertSongExists(Song song)`
- `editSong(Song newSong)`

### ✍️ Page Object: ApiTest.java

Encapsulates API behavior like validating that a song exists in the backend. Uses **RestAssured**.

### Example methods:
- `resetApp()`
- `getAllSongsAsPojo()`
- ...


### 🧪 Test Class: SongTests.java

This class uses the `SongPage` & `ApiClient` to test end-to-end song creation and editing, while also using JUnit features like:

- `@BeforeEach`: Prepare test (launch browser, reset database)
- `@AfterEach`: Quit driver, reset database

### 🧪 API Test Class: ApiTests.java

Uses `ApiClient` to call the song API. Instead of parsing strings, it uses the methods in `ApiClient`and maps to a `Song` POJO and validates values directly.

Remember: **The logic stays in the PageObjects** (or the client in this case)


## ✍️ Exercise 1: Create a Song - `SongTests.java`

> - Implement a test case that uses `SongPage.createSong(...)`.  
> -Then use `SongPage.assertSongExists(...)` to verify it shows up in the UI.

## ✍️ Exercise 2: Edit a Song - `SongTests.java`

> - After creation, call `SongPage.editSong(...)` and change a field.  
> - Verify with `assertSongExists(...)` that the change is reflected.

## ✍️ Exercise 3: API Assertion - `ApiTests.java`

> - Call the API in `ApiTest` and check the songs comming from the api .  
> - You can parse the response as a `Song[]` and assert with `assertEquals(...)`.
> - (Bonus:) Call the API in `ApiTest` and verify that the newly created song exists.  

## ✅ Benefits of This Setup

- Modular & clean
- Easy to expand
- Reusable logic
- Cross-functional (UI + API)

## 🚀 Tips

- Keep page objects lean.
- Add wait strategies inside PageObjects.
- Separate tests from test logic.

Happy testing!

## Summary

👉 Next up: This is it for this course! We hope that you had fun with our course. Of course there is more to explore to the selenium universe. We would recommend to take another deep look at [**Selenium Grid**](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/) (for executing selenium tests remote or also in a CI/CD context).
