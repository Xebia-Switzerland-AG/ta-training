# Writing End-to-End Tests with Selenium and Java

In this exercise we will combine everything learned so far.

You can create Selenium tests in two main ways:

1. **Generated** using Selenium IDE (export to Java + JUnit)
2. **Written manually** in `*Test.java` files using WebDriver

Start with the method you are most comfortable with. Later, try switching to another method and observe the difference.

What are your takeaways?

You can complete this exercise with the following commands:
- `driver.get("...")`
- `driver.findElement(By...)`  
  â†’ using different `By` types like `id`, `cssSelector`, `xpath`, etc.
- `element.sendKeys("...")`
- `element.click()`
- `assertEquals(actualValue, expectedValue)`

### âœ… JUnit 5 - Basic Assertion Methods

JUnit 5 provides a powerful set of assertions to validate your test outcomes.
Maybe you can use them in the test case:

| Method                      | Description                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `assertEquals(a, b)`       | Asserts that `a == b`                  |
| `assertNotEquals(a, b)`    | Asserts that `a != b`                  |
| `assertTrue(condition)`    | Asserts that the condition is `true`   |
| `assertFalse(condition)`   | Asserts that the condition is `false`  |
| `assertNull(obj)`          | Asserts that the object is `null`      |
| `assertNotNull(obj)`       | Asserts that the object is not `null`  |
| `assertThrows(...)`        | Expects an exception to be thrown      |

## Exercise: Adding a New Song

Let's create a test test creates our first song and validates it is shown on the first page. With the following steps:
- Clicks the `+` button on the Songs page
- Fills out the form (all fields are mandatory)
- Clicks **"CREATE SONG"**
- Asserts that the song is created on the first page

After writing the test, run it by clicking the green arrow in IntelliJ or use Maven.

You may find, that the test case will fail with the assertion part. 
You may look at [Selenium Waiters (specific: WebDriverWait)](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/waits/) to solve this exercise. Also take a look at [ExpectedConditions](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html) and the different [Locator Types](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/By.html).

## Exercise (optional): Run from the CLI

To run your test class from the command line:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=End2EndTest
```

Observe what happens. Does the test pass or fail? Why?

## Exercise: Start with a Clean Slate

If your application maintains state, reset it before running tests to ensure predictable behavior.

In this case, you can reset the state by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:8081/reset
```

After that, run your test again.


## Exercise: Cleaning up

Now that your first test runs, identify parts where you could refactor, meaning cleaning up. Are all the commands necessary? Can you remove some commands? This is especially useful if the test was generated using Selenium IDE.

## Exercise: Editing an Existing Song

Create a new test that:

1. Clicks the **"VIEW"** button for a song
2. On the details page, clicks **"EDIT"**
3. Updates fields and submits changes
4. Asserts the new data appears on the main list

What behavior do you observe? Does it work as expected?

Maybe the [Keys](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/Keys.html)-enum may help you while updating the value of a field.

## Exercise: Selector Review

Review your test:
- Are you happy with the selectors used?

Try to improve the selectors:
- Prefer using `By.id()`, `By.cssSelector()`, or XPath/CSS that is descriptive and stable
- Explore parent/child relationships using XPath axes like `contains(text()`, etc.

---

## Exercise: Assertions and Field Focus

Practice Selenium assertions and focus detection.

Try:

```java
WebElement searchField = driver.findElement(By.id("search"));
assertFalse(searchField.equals(driver.switchTo().activeElement()));
searchField.click();
assertEquals(searchField, driver.switchTo().activeElement());
```

This ensures the field initially has no focus, then gets focus on click.

## Summary

- You wrote a full end-to-end test using Selenium and Java
- You reset state, edited data, and cleaned up code
- You practiced with selectors and assertions

Great job â€” you're on your way to mastering end-to-end automation with Selenium ðŸš€
