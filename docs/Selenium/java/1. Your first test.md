# Your First Selenium Test (Java + JUnit)

In this exercise, you'll write and run your first Selenium test using Java and JUnit in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

## Exercise: The bare minimum

Letâ€™s start with the simplest Selenium test to launch a browser and open a webpage.

### Step 1: Create a test class

Inside `src/test/java`, create a file called `ExampleTest.java` with the following content:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class ExampleTest {

    @Test
    public void openXebiaWebsite() {
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://xebia.com/switzerland-de");
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

Make sure you have installed the Selenium driver dependencies as defined in your `pom.xml`.

> **Note**: Since we are using Selenium Manager (built into Selenium 4.6+), you donâ€™t need to download `chromedriver` manually.

## Exercise: Run first test case

Selenium opens a real browser by default (headed mode).  
Run your test using either:

- The green arrow in IntelliJ next to the method name (recommended for now).
- Or (optional) from the terminal using Maven ([this extra installation](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) is needed for that):

```bash
mvn test
```

A Chrome window should open, navigate to the site, and then close.

If you want the browser to stay open longer or to inspect it, continue to the next step.

---

## Exercise: Slowing down the test

Selenium executes very quickly, which makes it hard to observe whatâ€™s happening.  
For now you can add delays between actions to help you follow along.

Example using `Thread.sleep()`:

```java
@Test
public void slowTestExample() throws InterruptedException {
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver.get("https://xebia.com/switzerland-de");

    // Wait 3 seconds before quitting the browser
    Thread.sleep(3000);

    driver.quit();
}
```

> **Warning**: Never use `Thread.sleep()` in your final tests! Always use [Waiters](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/waits/).  
For this demo, however, itâ€™s fine. We will get back to Waiters later.

## Exercise: Catching up

Take some time to understand what this basic test is doing:
- It launches Chrome
- Navigates to the given URL
- Waits (optional)
- Then closes the browser

Try changing the URL or adding a new test to interact with the page.

## âœ… Recap

In this lesson, you:
- Created your first Selenium test
- Ran it in headed mode
- Added a delay to slow it down
- Saw how simple navigation works in Java + Selenium
