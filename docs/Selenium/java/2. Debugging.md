# Debugging Selenium Tests (Java + IntelliJ)

While slowing down tests can help visualize whatâ€™s happening, sometimes you need to zoom into specific test steps, especially when something fails.

This section will teach you how to debug Selenium tests using IntelliJ IDEA and Java.

## Exercise: Running in Debug Mode

You can debug any JUnit test directly from IntelliJ.

1. Open your test class, e.g. `ExampleTest.java`
2. Set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter next to a line (e.g., after `driver.get(...)`)
3. Right-click the test method â†’ choose **"Debug 'methodName'"**

The test will start in debug mode. When the breakpoint is hit, the execution will pause and allow you to inspect the browser state, step through code, or evaluate expressions.

## Exercise: Using a Debugger in IntelliJ

IntelliJ IDEA provides powerful debugging capabilities. You can:

- Step into / over methods
- Inspect variables like `WebElement`
- View call stacks
- Evaluate expressions during a paused state

Try this:
1. Set a breakpoint on `driver.get(...)`
2. Run the test in debug mode
3. When it pauses, inspect the `driver` and it's values

## Exercise: Advanced Debugging with Conditions

You can also use conditional breakpoints in IntelliJ:
- Right-click a breakpoint
- Add a condition like: `driver.getTitle().contains("Xebia")`

This ensures the debugger stops **only** when that condition is met. (In this case, the title of the current website must contain the value `Xebia`.)

## Summary

- Use **breakpoints** to inspect and step through test execution
- Debug directly in **IntelliJ IDEA** without extra tools
- Conditional breakpoints help narrow down problems
