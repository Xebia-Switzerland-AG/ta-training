# API Testing with Java (JUnit + REST Assured)

In this exercise, we will use **REST Assured** to make API requests.  
This is useful when you want to validate backend behavior without relying on UI interaction â€” ideal for frontend-related APIs or full-stack validation.

---

## Prerequisites

Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.rest-assured/rest-assured -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.skyscreamer/jsonassert -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.skyscreamer</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsonassert</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.3</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.18.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Exercise: Create a test class

Create a new file called `ApiTest.java` in `src/test/java/` and define a test.

## Exercise: Make a request

Make a GET request to `http://localhost:8081/songs` and expect a status code of `200 (OK)` is returned.

More info can be found [HERE](https://rest-assured.io/).

## Exercise: Match the returned response

Now expand your test by asserting that the First song is in the list of the returned songs:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "She's Kerosene",
  "artist": "The Interrupters",
  "genre": "Ska Punk",
  "album": "Fight the Good Fight",
  "albumImageUrl": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c9c292d93a9d27c4762cb559",
  "youtubeId": "Yq2jJLswL8I",
  "lyrics": "",
  "tab": "",
  "createdAt": "2018-02-13T12:56:24.432Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-04-07T18:16:02.146Z"
}
```

Remember, you can get the song-list and first song via:
```java
Response response = RestAssured.get("http://localhost:8081/songs");
String actualJson = response.getBody().jsonPath().getMap("[0]").toString();
```

In Java, there are many different ways to compare JSON. One of the easiest is JSONAssert. We added it before via the POM.

Play around with the `JSONCompareMode`. Find the mode that suits your test best.


> Hint - JSONCompareMode:
> - `STRICT`: Fields must match exactly
> - `LENIENT`: Ignores field order and allows missing fields in the actual JSON

## Bonus: Strong Typing with POJOs

You can also define a Java class to map the JSON structure:

```java
public class Song {
    public int id;
    public String title;
    public String artist;
    public String genre;
    public String album;
    public String albumImageUrl;
    public String youtubeId;
    public String lyrics;
    public String tab;
}
```

Then deserialize like this:

```java
Song[] songs = response.as(Song[].class);
assertEquals("She's Kerosene", songs[0].title);
```

## Summary

- You performed API tests in Java using REST Assured
- You validated response structure using JSONAssert
- You explored type-safe assertions with POJOs
